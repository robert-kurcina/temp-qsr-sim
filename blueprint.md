# Quantum Router Simulator

## Overview

A web-based application that simulates quantum network routing protocols. This tool is designed for researchers and developers to test and analyze the performance of quantum routing algorithms in a simulated environment.

## Project Outline

### Design and Styling

*   **Theme:** Dark mode, with a futuristic and scientific aesthetic.
*   **Layout:** Single-page application with a clear and intuitive structure.
*   **Colors:** A palette of dark grays, blues, and greens to create a high-tech feel.
*   **Typography:** Clean and modern sans-serif fonts for readability.
*   **Iconography:** Minimalistic icons to represent key concepts.

### Features

*   **Quantum Router Visualization:** An interactive 3D visualization of a quantum router and its connected nodes.
*   **Protocol Simulation:** The ability to simulate various quantum routing protocols.
*   **Performance Analysis:** Tools for analyzing and comparing the performance of different protocols.
*   **Customizable Parameters:** The ability to customize simulation parameters, such as network topology and noise levels.
