# Project Blueprint: MEST Tactics Simulator

## 1. Overview

This project is a headless wargame simulator designed to run in Firebase Studio. The goal is to create a flexible and performant simulator that can be easily extended with new rules and scenarios, with all interactions occurring via terminal scripts.

## 2. The Blueprint: Our Shared Source of Truth

**This document is the anchor for my behavior.**

Its purpose is to serve as our shared, persistent memory and single source of truth for the project. I will consult this document before every major action to ensure my behavior is consistent and aligned with the project's established rules and your expectations.

1.  **To Anchor Behavior:** The "Core Operating Principles," "Development Principles," "Development Environment," and "Testing and Debugging Methodology" sections are my explicit rulebook.
2.  **To Document the Project:** It acts as living, high-level documentation of the project's architecture, data models, and core logic.
3.  **To Manage Workflow:** The "Current Task" section is our shared to-do list, ensuring we are always on the same page.

My update process for this document is to **Read, Modify, and Write**. I will always read the file first, perform a targeted, non-destructive update, and then write the complete file back.

## 3. Core Operating Principles

1.  **Single Source of Truth:** The project's local files are the absolute and only source of truth. All data, including but not limited to character archetypes, items, weapons, armor, and game rules, MUST be drawn directly from the JSON files in `src/data/` and the markdown files (e.g., `rules.md`).
2.  **No Fabrication:** Under no circumstances should information be invented, fabricated, or inferred from external knowledge. If a piece of data does not exist explicitly in the project's files, it cannot be used.
3.  **Filesystem First:** Before making any changes or additions to the codebase, the filesystem must be scanned to confirm the presence or absence of relevant files.
4.  **Headless First Development:** All development must be focused on the core, headless simulation logic. UI-related files, dependencies (Astro, React, etc.), and configurations are to be ignored until explicitly commanded to work on them. The primary interface for the application is the command line.

### Filesystem Integrity

1.  **Always Audit Before Creating:** Before creating any new file, especially for a core module like `Character`, `Item`, or `DiceRoller`, I will **always** first list the files in the target directory to check for existing conflicts.
2.  **Refactor = Move, Verify, THEN Delete:** When refactoring by moving files, I will now follow a strict "move, verify, delete" sequence. I will not consider the refactor complete until the old file is explicitly deleted and the system is tested again.

## 4. Development Environment & Toolchain

*   **Testing Framework:** Vitest
*   **Transpiler:** TypeScript compiler (`tsc`)
*   **Module System:** ES Modules
*   **Target Environment:** Node.js
*   **TypeScript Execution:** `tsx`

## 5. Development Principles

1.  **Unit Testing as a Priority:** Every new feature, rule, or piece of logic must be accompanied by a comprehensive set of unit tests.
2.  **Separation of Responsibilities (SOLID):** The codebase will adhere to SOLID design principles, with a strong emphasis on the Single Responsibility Principle. Complex processes will be broken down into smaller, modular, and independently testable subroutines.
3.  **No Regular Expressions for Complex Parsing:** Avoid using regular expressions for parsing structured strings with multiple, potentially ambiguous parts (e.g., damage formulas). Instead, use simple, character-by-character string manipulation to ensure clarity, predictability, and ease of debugging. Regex should only be used for simple, well-defined pattern matching.
4.  **Debugging with Console Logs:** When unit tests fail, introduce `console.log` statements to the relevant code to help with debugging. These logs should be removed only after a successful `npm test` run.
5.  **Declare and Use Variables for Function Arguments:** Always declare variables for function arguments. Never pass a non-variable argument to a function.

## 6. Testing and Debugging Methodology

To ensure a stable and predictable codebase, the following systematic approach will be used to address all unit test failures:

1.  **Isolate and Prioritize:** When a test run results in failures, identify the **least dependent failing test**.
2.  **Focus on a Single Test:** Concentrate all efforts on fixing this single, isolated test.
3.  **Iterate Until Passing:** Run the test repeatedly in isolation until it passes. No other tests will be addressed during this time.
4.  **Incremental Progression:** Once the test passes, move to the next least dependent failing test and repeat the process until all tests in a file are passing.
5.  **File-by-File Completion:** Once all tests in a file pass, move to the next file with failing tests and repeat the process.
6.  **Full Suite Validation:** After all tests in all files pass, run the entire test suite one final time to confirm success.
7.  **`TypeError` is a Structural Red Flag:** `TypeError` and `ReferenceError` will be treated not just as code errors, but as high-priority red flags for potential structural problems like duplicate modules. I will investigate the file system *before* the code logic in these cases.

## 7. Codebase Conventions & Standards

1.  **Dice Enum:** The enum for dice variations will be named `DiceType` (plural).
2.  **Result Interfaces:** Interfaces for action results will be named descriptively (e.g., `DisengageResult`).

## 8. Game Documentation

*   [Mastery](src/guides/docs/mastery.md)
*   [Rules](src/guides/docs/rules.md)

## 8.1 Context Anchors (Non-UI Docs)

The project includes markdown files that serve as **AI context anchors** to narrow behavior and ensure consistent rule interpretation. These are **not** UI content and are **not** intended to be treated as Astro content collections or rendered in any interface. They may be stored outside `src/content` to avoid Astro content-collection warnings.

## 9. Project Implementation Details

### Core Mechanics

*   **Dice Types:** `Base`, `Modifier`, `Wild`.
*   **Success & Carry-Over:** Defined in `getDieSuccesses`. The key is that a roll generates successes and can *also* generate a single carry-over die for a subsequent round.
*   **`performTest`:** Executes a *single round* of dice rolls and reports the score and any carry-over dice. It does **not** recursively roll carry-over dice.
*   **`resolveTest`:** The high-level orchestrator for a contested roll between two participants. It calculates dice pools, calls `performTest` for each, and determines the final outcome.

### Actions

*   **`makeDisengageAction`:** The primary implemented action. It gathers situational modifiers (`isCornered`, `isFlanked`, etc.) and uses `resolveTest` to determine the result.

### Data Model

*   **`Character`**, **`Profile`**, **`Item`**.
*   Game data is stored statically in `src/lib/data.ts`.

## 10. Current Task: Capture Spatially Aware Game Requirements

### Completed Steps

1.  **Corrected `dice-roller.ts` and `dice-roller.test.ts`:** The core dice-rolling logic is now fixed and validated.
2.  **Established `blueprint.md`:** This document has been created and refined to serve as our single source of truth.
3.  **Corrected `hit-test.test.ts`:** All tests related to hit resolution are now passing.
4.  **Implemented `damage-parser.ts`:** The damage formula parser has been rewritten to use robust string manipulation instead of regular expressions.
5.  **Implemented `damage.ts` and `damage.test.ts`:** The core damage subroutine and its tests are now fully implemented and passing, ensuring correct wound calculation, status effects (KO/Elimination), and dice modifier handling.
6.  **Refactored `Character.ts` to a class:** `Character.ts` is now a class that takes a `Profile` in its constructor.
7.  **Created `types.ts`:** `FinalAttributes` and `ArmorState` are now in a separate file.
8.  **Updated `battlefield.test.ts`:** The test now uses the new `Character` class structure.
9.  **All unit tests passing:** Full suite is green.
10. **Implemented profile/assembly pipeline:** Added profile builder and assembly creation helpers to turn archetypes + items into characters within an assembly.

### Next Steps

Define and implement the minimum game loop and spatial model required by the QSR to make the simulator "spatially aware" and playable:

1.  **Battlefield Model (Spatial Awareness Core)**  
    Represent a battlefield with measurable MU distances, model base sizes (diameter/height), and model volumes for LOS checks. Support LOS/LOF rules, including blocking terrain, cover determination (direct/intervening), and visibility OR constraints.
2.  **Terrain & Movement Rules**  
    Encode terrain categories (Clear, Rough, Difficult, Blocking) and movement costs, including base-contact constraints, engagement, and agility-based movement exceptions.
3.  **Mission Setup & Game Size**  
    Implement mission configuration for the default “Elimination” mission, including game size assumptions (Small), model count, and BP budget constraints.
4.  **Turn & Action Loop (Playable Flow)**  
    Implement turn structure with Ready/Done statuses, core actions (Move, Close Combat Attack, Ranged Attack, Disengage), and basic status token handling (Hidden, Wound, Delay, Fear, KO, Eliminated).

### Spatial Awareness Priorities (2D Footprint Placeholder)

Model volume is temporarily treated as a 2D footprint (base circle/mesh). Priorities are ordered from least-dependent to most-dependent:

1.  **Model registry + measurement utilities**
2.  **Engagement + melee range checks**
3.  **LOS + LOF integration (2D footprint)**
4.  **Cover classification (direct/intervening, hard/soft/blocking)**
5.  **Cohesion + situational awareness**
6.  **Safety + compulsory actions**
7.  **Hidden/Detect/Wait spatial interactions**

### Mission Side Wiring (Near-Term Plan)

1.  **MissionSide bindings**  
    Establish a side-level container that binds Assemblies to a Side and assigns portrait call signs, model slots, positions, and per-character status. This is the primary home for side-specific state.
2.  **Assembly merge builder**  
    Provide a helper to combine multiple Assemblies into a single composite roster (e.g., 250 BP + 500 BP → 750 BP) before assigning to a Side.
3.  **Side assignment flow**  
    Allow multiple Assemblies to be assigned to a Side (with or without merging) and maintain a single roster with consistent identifiers.

### Future UI Flow (Non-Blocking)

At some point a UI will be needed to:
- Build Profiles
- Build Characters from Profiles
- Build Assemblies from Characters
- Assign Assemblies to Mission Sides

## 11. Mission Engine Roadmap

### Scope Summary

Full mission implementation includes: a data-driven mission engine, objective marker system, POI control, VIP logic, mission keys, and mission-specific triggers integrated into `GameController` and `mission-flow`, with unit tests.

### Priority Order (Least Impact First)

1.  **QAI Mission 1: Elimination**
2.  **QAI Mission 12: Engagement**
3.  **QAI Mission 14: Beacon**
4.  **QAI Mission 16: Exfil**
5.  **QAI Mission 15: Extraction Point**
6.  **QAI Mission 13: Sabotage**
7.  **QAI Mission 18: Ghost Protocol**
8.  **QAI Mission 20: Switchback**
9.  **QAI Mission 17: Triad**
10. **QAI Mission 19: Last Stand**

### Shared Feature Modules (Engine Work)

These modules unlock multiple missions and should be built before mission-specific logic.

1.  **Core mission engine (data-driven)**
2.  **Mission keys/scoring extensions** (Dominance, Courier, Sanctuary, First Blood, Catalyst, Collection, POI, Targeted, etc.)
3.  **POI / zone control**
4.  **Objective Markers (OM) system**
5.  **VIP system**
6.  **Reinforcements system**
