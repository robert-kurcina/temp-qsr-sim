# Project Blueprint: MEST Tactics Simulator

## 1. Overview

This project is a headless wargame simulator designed to run in Firebase Studio. The goal is to create a flexible and performant simulator that can be easily extended with new rules and scenarios, with all interactions occurring via terminal scripts.

## 2. The Blueprint: Our Shared Source of Truth

**This document is the anchor for my behavior.**

Its purpose is to serve as our shared, persistent memory and single source of truth for the project. I will consult this document before every major action to ensure my behavior is consistent and aligned with the project's established rules and your expectations.

1.  **To Anchor Behavior:** The "Core Operating Principles," "Development Principles," "Development Environment," and "Testing and Debugging Methodology" sections are my explicit rulebook.
2.  **To Document the Project:** It acts as living, high-level documentation of the project's architecture, data models, and core logic.
3.  **To Manage Workflow:** The "Current Task" section is our shared to-do list, ensuring we are always on the same page.

My update process for this document is to **Read, Modify, and Write**. I will always read the file first, perform a targeted, non-destructive update, and then write the complete file back.

## 3. Core Operating Principles

1.  **Single Source of Truth:** The project's local files are the absolute and only source of truth. All data, including but not limited to character archetypes, items, weapons, armor, and game rules, MUST be drawn directly from the JSON files in `src/data/` and the markdown files (e.g., `rules.md`).
2.  **No Fabrication:** Under no circumstances should information be invented, fabricated, or inferred from external knowledge. If a piece of data does not exist explicitly in the project's files, it cannot be used.
3.  **Filesystem First:** Before making any changes or additions to the codebase, the filesystem must be scanned to confirm the presence or absence of relevant files.
4.  **Headless First Development:** All development must be focused on the core, headless simulation logic. UI-related files, dependencies (Astro, React, etc.), and configurations are to be ignored until explicitly commanded to work on them. The primary interface for the application is the command line.

## 4. Development Environment & Toolchain

*   **Testing Framework:** Vitest
*   **Transpiler:** TypeScript compiler (`tsc`)
*   **Module System:** ES Modules
*   **Target Environment:** Node.js
*   **TypeScript Execution:** `tsx`

## 5. Development Principles

1.  **Unit Testing as a Priority:** Every new feature, rule, or piece of logic must be accompanied by a comprehensive set of unit tests.
2.  **Separation of Responsibilities (SOLID):** The codebase will adhere to SOLID design principles, with a strong emphasis on the Single Responsibility Principle. Complex processes will be broken down into smaller, modular, and independently testable subroutines.
3.  **No Regular Expressions for Complex Parsing:** Avoid using regular expressions for parsing structured strings with multiple, potentially ambiguous parts (e.g., damage formulas). Instead, use simple, character-by-character string manipulation to ensure clarity, predictability, and ease of debugging. Regex should only be used for simple, well-defined pattern matching.
4.  **Debugging with Console Logs:** When unit tests fail, introduce `console.log` statements to the relevant code to help with debugging. These logs should be removed only after a successful `npm test` run.

## 6. Testing and Debugging Methodology

To ensure a stable and predictable codebase, the following systematic approach will be used to address all unit test failures:

1.  **Isolate and Prioritize:** When a test run results in failures, identify the **least dependent failing test**.
2.  **Focus on a Single Test:** Concentrate all efforts on fixing this single, isolated test.
3.  **Iterate Until Passing:** Run the test repeatedly in isolation until it passes. No other tests will be addressed during this time.
4.  **Incremental Progression:** Once the test passes, move to the next least dependent failing test and repeat the process until all tests in a file are passing.
5.  **File-by-File Completion:** Once all tests in a file pass, move to the next file with failing tests and repeat the process.
6.  **Full Suite Validation:** After all tests in all files pass, run the entire test suite one final time to confirm success.

## 7. Codebase Conventions & Standards

1.  **Dice Enum:** The enum for dice variations will be named `DiceType` (plural).
2.  **Result Interfaces:** Interfaces for action results will be named descriptively (e.g., `DisengageResult`).

## 8. Game Documentation

*   [Mastery](src/content/docs/mastery.md)
*   [Rules](src/content/docs/rules.md)

## 9. Project Implementation Details

### Core Mechanics

*   **Dice Types:** `Base`, `Modifier`, `Wild`.
*   **Success & Carry-Over:** Defined in `getDieSuccesses`. The key is that a roll generates successes and can *also* generate a single carry-over die for a subsequent round.
*   **`performTest`:** Executes a *single round* of dice rolls and reports the score and any carry-over dice. It does **not** recursively roll carry-over dice.
*   **`resolveTest`:** The high-level orchestrator for a contested roll between two participants. It calculates dice pools, calls `performTest` for each, and determines the final outcome.

### Actions

*   **`makeDisengageAction`:** The primary implemented action. It gathers situational modifiers (`isCornered`, `isFlanked`, etc.) and uses `resolveTest` to determine the result.

### Data Model

*   **`Character`**, **`Profile`**, **`Item`**.
*   Game data is stored statically in `src/lib/data.ts`.

## 10. Current Task: Implement Damage Subroutine

### Completed Steps

1.  **Corrected `dice-roller.ts` and `dice-roller.test.ts`:** The core dice-rolling logic is now fixed and validated.
2.  **Established `blueprint.md`:** This document has been created and refined to serve as our single source of truth.
3.  **Corrected `hit-test.test.ts`:** All tests related to hit resolution are now passing.
4.  **Implemented `damage-parser.ts`:** The damage formula parser has been rewritten to use robust string manipulation instead of regular expressions.
5.  **Implemented `damage.ts` and `damage.test.ts`:** The core damage subroutine and its tests are now fully implemented and passing, ensuring correct wound calculation, status effects (KO/Elimination), and dice modifier handling.

### Next Steps

The damage subroutine is complete. We are now ready for the next task.
