# Situational Test Modifiers

These are conditions if when met affect how bonus and penalty dice are assigned.

## Overview

There are common situations which arise that will affect the ability of characters to pass Tests. These are known as Situational Test Modifiers, and they are listed in a set of tables at the right under their commonly referenced name. These entries will be explained in the proper context in the later sections of the rules. For now, consider these to be a reference used during game-play as a reminder. All of the terms used are described in the next few sections.

*   Penalties are listed as -1, -1m, -1b, or -1w, and bonuses are listed as +1, +1m, +1b, or +1w.
*   Modifiers usually are set for the Active or Attacker character unless they specify the target or Defender. Some modifiers apply to both models within a test.
*   Every Test, except for the Damage Tests, will always require use of these Situational Test Modifiers.
*   The most commonly applied Situation Test Modifiers will be for Hindrances.

# General Terms

MEST Tactics requires the use of many game-specific terminologies to make rules precise and clear.

## Common Terminology

*   **Initiative** — The character (its model and player) whose turn it is or was at the start of a Turn.
*   **Target** — A target is either a model, a battlefield location, or terrain elements such as a tree or building.
*   **Active** — The character (its model and player) whose turn it is at the moment to complete an Action.
*   **Passive** — The character (its model and player) which is the target of an action by the Active character.
*   **Attacker** — The character (its model and player) performing an Attack action.
*   **Defender** — The character (its model and player) which is the target of an Attack action.
*   **Scrum** — A Scrum is when three or more Opposing models are Engaged or within Melee Range of others.
*   **Outnumbers** — A model Outnumbers its target if it has more Attentive Ordered Friendly models with the same Opposing model in Melee Range.
*   **Agility** — Agility is a feature of movement and can be used in combination with it. It is equal to half a character’s MOV, keeping fractions. See the section on Performing Movement under “Agility” for more information.
*   **Physicality & Durability**— Physicality is the higher of SIZ or STR. Durability is the higher of SIZ or FOR.
*   **base-contact** — A model is in base-contact if its base touches and it is anywhere within the height of the other model. The bases of models should not be allowed to overlap.
*   **Facing** — How a model faces or its “facing” is not a factor in game-play.
*   **Core Damage** — This is a weapon’s flat value for Damage rating plus the number of dice it would roll. For example; a Sword or Spear with a Damage rating of STR + 2m has a Core Damage 4, if STR were 2. For example; Throwing Knives have a Damage rating of STR - 1w, and if STR were 2 this would be Core Damage 1.
*   **Hindrance** — Hindrances are status tokens such as Wound, Delay, and Fear.
    *   When assigned to a character, the character is of that status type, such “Wounded” (Wound), “Distracted” (Delay), or “Nervous” (Fear).
    *   Each type of Hindrance assigned to a character causes it to be penalized at -1 Modifier die all Tests except for the Damage Test.

## Standard Conditions

Each of the Standard Conditions usually have a pairing. Friendly and Opposing are pairs, same as Hidden or Revealed.

*   **Friendly** — All models controlled by the same player, or by players of the same Side, are Friendly.
*   **Opposing** —Models which are not Friendly are Opposing.
*   **Ready** — All models begin each Mission as Ready.
*   **Done** — Characters that have completed all of their activities are Done. These models are marked with a Done token. KO’d characters are never Ready; always Done, and never Active.
*   **In-Play** — A character that is not KO’d or Eliminated is In-Play.
*   **Out-of-Play** — A character not In-Play. Usually KO’d or Eliminated.
*   **KO’d** — A model is KO’d when it has received Wound tokens matching its SIZ. KO’d models never cause Opposing models to be Engaged.
*   **Eliminated** — Characters which have been removed from play are Eliminated. A character is Eliminated when it is no longer in play as result of movement, combat, fear, or other means. Exiting the battlefield is automatic Elimination.
*   **Revealed** — Characters that are not Hidden are instead Revealed.
*   **Hidden** — Some characters may become Hidden during the course of the game.
*   **Attentive** — Characters are usually Attentive unless Knocked-out [ KO’d ].
*   **Distracted** — The opposite of Attentive is Distracted. Models with Delay tokens are Distracted.
*   **Ordered** — Characters which are not Disordered are instead Ordered.
*   **Disordered** — Characters with 2 or more Fear tokens are Disordered.
*   **Free** — Models that are not Engaged are Free.
*   **Melee Range** — A target is within Melee Range if its volume is in base-contact with an Opposing model's volume.
*   **Engaged** — A model is considered Engaged if it is within the Melee Range of an Opposing model.

# Combat Rules

## Weapon Properties

Any entries which have only a dash (-) are considered to either not be relevant (such as for OR) or be empty (such as for Traits). Each entry in the various Weapon lists is described with these properties:

*   **Name** — The name of the weapon.
*   **Class** — The class of the weapon (e.g., Thrown, Bow, Melee).
*   **OR** — Optimal Range. Used for ranged attacks.
*   **Acc** — Accuracy. Used for Attacker Hit Tests.
*   **Impact** — Impact rating [I]. Reduces target's total Armor Rating [AR] for the Damage Test.
*   **Damage** — The Damage Rating for Damage Tests.
*   **STR** — Indicates the weapon uses the character's STR attribute for OR or Damage.
*   **Traits** — Special properties of the weapon.
*   **BP** — Build Points to purchase the item.

## Armor Properties

Any entries which have only a dash (-) are considered to either not be relevant (such as for AR), or be empty (such as for Traits). Each entry in the various Armor lists is described with these properties:

*   **Name** — The name of the armor.
*   **Type** — The type of armor.
*   **AR** — Armor Rating. Reduces Wound damage.
*   **Traits** — Special properties of the armor.
*   **BP** — Build Points to purchase the item.

## Performing Close Combat

This is an Attack action. The Active character acquires a Delay token if this is not its first attack this Initiative (unless using a Natural weapon).

1.  **Announce Weapon:** Each player announces a Melee or Natural weapon.
2.  **Announce Target:** Announce a Revealed model within Melee Range and LOS.
3.  **Overreach (Optional):** Attacker may increase Melee Range by +1 MU for their first action, taking a -1 REF and -1 penalty to the Close Combat Test.
4.  **Resolve Hit Test:** Perform an Opposed CCA test, applying relevant Situational Modifiers and the weapon's Accuracy bonus.
5.  **Proceed to Damage Test:** If the Hit Test passes, perform a Close Combat Damage Test.

## Performing Direct Range Combat

This is an Attack action against Revealed targets in LOS. The Active character acquires a Delay token if this is not its first attack this Initiative (unless using a Natural weapon).

1.  **Announce Weapon:** Announce a Ranged weapon (one with an OR value, or Thrown/Throwable).
2.  **Announce Target:** Announce a Revealed model within LOS.
3.  **Resolve Hit Test:** Perform an Opposed RCA vs. REF test, applying relevant Situational Modifiers and the weapon's Accuracy bonus.
4.  **Proceed to Damage Test:** If the Hit Test passes, perform a Range Combat Damage Test.
